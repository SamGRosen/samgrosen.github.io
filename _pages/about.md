About me
======

Originally from Maryland, I came to [UMass: Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) to study Mathematics and Computer Science. Currently I am applying to PhD programs for Fall 2021 that focus on using mathematics or statistics to solve problems related to understanding relational data. Some specific problems I'm particularly interested in are applications of [latent space graphical models](/portfolio/rdpg-sampler), [community detection](/writings/two-truths), and building scalable graph systems. At UMass, I most enjoyed my time as a teaching assistant for *Calculus 1* as it gave me the opportunity to teach students directly. In my free-time I like to read, create generative art, listen to music, and watch baseball. I have been fortunate enough to pursue opportunities at [General Dynamics Mission Systems](https://gdmissionsystems.com/), [Johns Hopkins University: Applied Physics Lab](https://www.jhuapl.edu/), and [DraftKings](https://www.draftkings.com/). This fall I will start an internship at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com) working on the cloud integrations team.
