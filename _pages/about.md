About me
======

Originally from Maryland, I came to [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) to study Mathematics and Computer Science. After applying to programs focusing on using mathematics or statistics to solve problems related to understanding relational data, I have decided to join the [statistics department at Duke](https://stat.duke.edu/) as a PhD student. Some specific problems I'm particularly interested in are applications of [latent space graphical models](/portfolio/rdpg-sampler), [community detection](/writings/two-truths), and building scalable graph systems. At UMass, I most enjoyed my time as a teaching assistant for *Calculus 1* as it gave me the opportunity to teach students directly. In my free-time I like to read, create generative art, listen to music, and watch baseball. I have been fortunate enough to pursue opportunities at [General Dynamics Mission Systems](https://gdmissionsystems.com/), [Johns Hopkins University: Applied Physics Lab](https://www.jhuapl.edu/), [DraftKings](https://www.draftkings.com/), and Datadog [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com). This summer I will be a research and development intern at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com) working on the [Epiviz](https://epiviz.github.io/) project.
